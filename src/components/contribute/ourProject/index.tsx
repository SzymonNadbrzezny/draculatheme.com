        Dracula Theme is an open-source project driven by and for the community.
        Most apps that support the theme are contributions from our community.
      </p>

        As much as the team is responsible for the core theme and wants to
        support all available applications, we simply don&apos;t have the
        capacity to do it all ourselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        That&apos;s why the community is essential for this project to keep
        evolving. Below are some guidelines, tips, and specifications for those
        who want to apply the theme to any application.
